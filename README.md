# Refactoring -- Challenge 1
## Description
This is a refactoring of some code provided to me by the U of U bootcamp program. I am changing this code's elements to semantic elements, ensuring images and icons have alt attributes, and consolidating the stylesheet's structure, along with other improvements to the code's overall structure and readability as I see fit.
This will all be done in an effort to approve the provided site's accessability and search engine optimization.
**I will be documenting my changes via comments throughout the code to make grading easier.**
